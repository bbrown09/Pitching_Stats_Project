# Pitching_Stats_Project

This repository contains a data set based on Major League Baseball pitching stats from 2014 to 2021. It also contains the python code that was used to scrape the data from MLB.com. For simplicity’s sake, it only pulled the top 200 pitcher’s stats based on total games played in order to have the pitchers with the largest sample sizes. The stats are labeled by their common abbreviations which are written out below for those who aren’t as familiar with them. There is an extra file with data of the top 200 pitchers of 2021 just as a backup data set that I was also curious to explore.
